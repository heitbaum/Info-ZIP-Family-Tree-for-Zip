All of the files are in Unix (LF only) format. On MSDOS and OS/2
systems, you can use the -a option of unzip to convert the source
files to CRLF format.  This is only necessary if you use Turbo/Borland C
-- they will compile as is with Microsoft C. You should be able to
find unzip the same place you found this (see the file 'Where').
