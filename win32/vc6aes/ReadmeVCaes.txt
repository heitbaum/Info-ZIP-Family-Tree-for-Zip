VC6aes Readme

This directory has a VC6 project list that can be used to compile Zip
and the utilities with AES encryption.  It does not include bzip2 support.

The vc6 directory has a project list for compiling Zip without bz2 or aes.
The vc6bz2 directory provides a project list for including bzip2 support in
Zip.  Currently there is not a project that includes both bz2 and aes, but
that should be coming shortly.
